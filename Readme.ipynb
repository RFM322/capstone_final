    ">**Project overview:<a id=\"po\"></a>**  <br><br> While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) are typically used for image recognition problems, this project explores the use of CNN's on an unconventional data architecture to improve accuracy on instances of limited information. The proposed architecture includes businesses, \"distances\" (or \"radius of influence\"), \"business categories\", and features from the Yelp Academic Dataset as dimensions of the 4D tensor fed into the CNN. <br><br> The model attempts to classify businesses between \"permanently closed\" and \"open\" based on benchmarks with neighbouring businesses and the proposed data architecture.<br><br> The final model used is a multi input model that combines a feed forward neural network and a convolutional neural network. This approach adds layers of complexity to the data structure in hopes that the model picks up in dimensional patters that 2D data architectures would not. <br><br> Overall, the use of a more complex data structure marginally increased overall accuracy. Comparatively speaking, the proposed model pipeline performed better than optimized Random Forests and Support Vector machines.\n",

    "## Installation <a id=\"ins\"></a>\n",
    "The following libraries are requiered to execute the code contained in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Data handling, time and distance, combiantions, modelling and language processing\n",
    "numpy, pandas, json, utm, time, itertools, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, regex, textblob, nltk, gensim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify that the most up to date version of the libraries mentioned above have been installed in your computer. For a guideline on python installation of modules please refer to the __[official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources <a id=\"ds\"></a>\n",
    "Data used for this project comes from the **[Yelp Academic Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)** from 2019. Raw json files can be downloaded directly from Yelp's web page. Due to size constraints they were not included in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed data architecture <a id=\"pda\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    ">The thesis behind the implementation of an unconventional data architecture is that, on situations where data is limited, adding layers of complexity will increase accuracy. <br><br> The data that can be retrieved from **[Yelp's API](https://www.yelp.com/developers)** and the **Academic Dataset** is limited and does not provide a significant amount of information regarding the reasons behind a business closure. Features such as \"stars\" or \"rating\", number of checkins, etc. do not provide a robust explanatory power on their own. <br><br> Nevertheless, a reasonable workaround to this limitation is to compare a given business against its neighboring competitors, under the assumption that low performing businesses relative to surrounding businesses are more likely to close. This approach has the benefit to consider within it the variations on business attributes by geography, distance, and business category, which might problematic on a 2D model.   \n",

    "\n",
    ">As shown on the image above, we attempt to achieve this by creating a parameter grid for each business, where: <br><br> - **(a)** the ***y*** axis of the grid relates to distances from the target business. The center of the grid repsents the smallest distance (radius), and it expands north and south as you approach the edges. <br><br> - **(B)** the ***x*** axis represents different business categories. The center of the grid relates to the same business category as the target business, as you approach the edges of the grid the similarity of such categories with the target business decreases. <br><br> - **(c)** the intersect of the ***y*** and ***x*** axis is comprosed of an array of features. Each element of the array (feature) is computed as the difference between the target business's measurement and the average of the surrounding/neighbouring businesses that fit such criteria (distance and category) - *we refer to this computation as \"benchmarking\"* -.\n",

    "For practical purposes we carried out this analysis on a densley populated business area. Running the script over a larger geographical area was beyond the computing capabilities and resources at hand as of the moment of developing this project. \n",

    "Distances were calculated with the Euclidean distance based on UTM for computational efficiency. Due to the size of the area of influence this calculation did not affect significantly the accuracy of distance. Nevertheless, in future iterations it would be reccomended to take into account more accurate distance measurements, speacially as the area of interest increases in size.\n",
